I was on my second tube with no problems and ordered a third, when I was ready to use it, it was more than 30 days old.

Then I went back to the tube that tested, within a couple of days the bottom split open.  This tube seems to be a softer consistency which should help, but it does not, it still splits open.

It is a magazine for those who love antiques and also those who consider themselves historians since many articles deal with historical collections of art and antiques.\n",
       "\n",
       "This magazine is overflowing with antique goods and information. The articles contained in this magazine are intended to be visually stimulating in some cases, educational in others. They offer history lessons on the art that was popular during a specific era, a glimpse into an art collection at a museum, and more. The articles are meant to stimulate the interests of those who already like this subject and they often provide a means to learn more, to discover places to see or purchase some of the featured works, and to develop an appreciation for the craftsmanship that went into making these items.\n",
       "\n",
       "Antiques Magazine is a publication dedicated to creative art and history but one thing that isn't very creative is the titles of the articles. This might surprise some readers at first, but the editors at Antiques decided to get straight to the point in the naming of the featured articles rather than try to be creative. The features thus have titles like \"The Eating Utensil Collection\", \"Spanish Culture in Art\", etc. Each title points out exactly what the article covers, leaving nothing to the imagination.\n",
       "\n",
       "The writing in Antiques is certainly good and well- edited. But I'm afraid that many readers will find the articles a little boring. They describe things well and they usually offer a good history lesson. But they lack spark and readability. I have tried to read some articles in this magazine and found my eyelids getting heavy and my thoughts drifting to other subjects. This is why I generally stick with the pictures when I glance at Antiques Magazine. I don't bother reading because most of the material doesn't keep my interest.\n",

This is a good magazine. I will cut to the chase about why I subscribe to it and the reason why most everyone else out there does too - it's those program CD-ROMs that include a ton of things that you can use that are mostly all free. Yah, I can go out and find them myself instead of having the CD-ROM at your disposal, but often you do not know what you are looking for when you search online for a solution or program... ... or your search engine overlooks a program(s) out there that you want. There are tons of handy and very useful tools and utilities on them.  It saves me a lot of work searching. This is the plus.\n",
       "Now, the magazine articles are okay. Lately, I have found that they are discussing issues not of importance to me. I am seeing more ads in them than the older issues that had better old core help providing assistance with common programs users have and solutions to common issues. Once in a while I find in an issue an article I like that serves some use, but it is now hit or miss. It used to be that EVERY issue had some practical assistance I could use. Again, the reason that I subscribe is those CD-ROMs, I will not lie here.\n",
       "Now, the latest issue I am having with them is there subscription renewal service after you have had them for one year (or more) and they tell you that you need to renew when you haven't finished receiving all your paid subscription issues. They tell you that you HAVE received (in my case) all 12 issues when I have only received 10 to date. They state that they expect to receive you payment for renewal when you haven't finished your first year subscription service. NOW, WAIT A MINUTE HERE! I still have 2 issues before my current subscription is done.  I believe that I will pay them when my renewal is done. After I receive my last two (2) issues for this subscription period, them I will pay to renew for the next subscription period. The reason why I do not pay in advance is I will get short changed and it makes it very difficult to correct this issue at a later date.  I had an issue with this and I need it resolved, so I contacted their customer service department via e-mail.  They replied back to me promptly. They stated that my last two issues were in the mailing process and my current subscription period will expire in November 2010 which is correct. I agree when it will expire. We are on the same page here. However, \"when payment is received, service will continue through the October 2010 issue.\" Now, this is B.S. They are holding back on my last 2 issues that I paid for until they receive my payment. What if I did NOT want to renew this magazine? Does this mean I do not get my last 2 issues (Oct. & Nov. 2010) that I paid for? This is not fair business practices!!! They are still obligated to still send me my last 2 issues regardless if I renew or not. I am a little angered here. Yes, I like the magazine for obvious reasons and I will renew; but this is not fair at all!

As some of the other reviewers have noted, a huge portion of the magazine is taken up with glossy advertising, most of which is for clothing that only investment bankers or movie stars are likely to purchase. I like clothes, but it would be nice to see clothing lines other than couture advertised. More disturbingly, the magazine seems to have a split personality in its approach to masculinity. Many articles are written from the viewpoint of the stereotypical uber-masculine American male, with lots of references to heterosexual relationships, and other \"guy stuff.\" Yet other articles come off as attempting to be from a gay-friendly viewpoint. I prefer the latter, but I don't see the point in having gay-friendly material when the rest of the magazine is trying to be a go-to guide for red-blooded males. I guess I don't fully \"get\" the editorial viewpoint that Details (purports to be) espousing.

There was also an article about flowers and their importance to protests and the \"Resist\" movement. The only other content was ads and product shilling. Why they felt the need to politicize fashion/beauty is beyond me, and I cant imagine anyone wants to get their social/political commentary sandwiched between lipstick and shampoo ads out of a magazine called \"Allure\".

The main group that Details aims to capture is the 17 to 35 year- old male but there are articles in each magazine that could be appealing to men of many different ages, mostly in the middle to upper income groups.\n",
       "\n",
       "Some things about Details quickly set it apart from other magazines. One difference is the \"departments\". Most magazines have departments, but instead of talking about the same things each month, these departments vary in their content (the only exceptions being \"Know- Tell\" and the \"The Details\"). Each one contains similar stories from one month to the next, but with different subtitles, helping to make each issue a little fresher than it would otherwise be.\n",
       "\n",
       "As far as the writing goes, Details offers a great deal of diversity for a magazine. Yes, it is generally focused on things of interest to men, but it covers a very broad range of interests. You can find articles in this magazine on such diverse topics as the death penalty, raising kids, buying a new coat, setting up an internet business, breaking up with a girlfriend, or purchasing the best vodka. There are articles geared toward single men and married men, as well as younger men and middle- aged men.\n",
       "\n",
       "I like some of the articles found here but there is one problem I have with the writing in Details. It is common to find eye- catching headlines on the cover of Details that tempt you to find out more. This is nothing new and most every magazine does this. But the problem is that many of these eye- popping stories fail to keep you amazed when you read them. Take for example an article in a recent issue. On the front, it reads \"Is Your Wife a Bad Mom\"? It sound like an engaging, intellectual read. But once you find the article and take in its 1,000+ words, you quickly discover that there is little or no substance. Basically, it simply tells men that accusing your wife of being a bad mom is a risky undertaking that could hurt her feelings. That is it. There is no intellectual analysis or quotes from studies; only the bottom line conclusion that mothers generally don't like to be called incompetent by their husbands. Other headlining articles in this magazine lead to similar disappointment.\n",
       "\n",
       "The writing in this magazine is on the edge and very blunt. It is common to find several four- letter words in many of the articles and while this doesn't bother me at all, I know that some readers will consider it too raw, too edgy, and too explicit. Details writers have no problem telling it like it is, and this can be both good and bad depending on one's perspective.\n",
       "\n",
       "Besides the language, some parts of this magazine could offend certain readers; namely the \"Anthropology\" page at the end. This closing \"article\" is meant to be humorous, but some readers will not see it that way. I don't know if it has always been this way, but what \"Anthropology\" does is show a person or multiple people and then asks the question \"Gay or ______\". For example, I have seen titles like \"Gay or Best Friends?\", \"Gay or Cowboy?\", \"Gay or Neo Punk Rocker?\", and others. With each of these, there is a diagram of sorts with arrows pointing to different clothing and bodily features and short comments about each one. Basically, it is asking you to think about these different attributes of the person or people in the picture and then decide if the way they dress, look, and act makes them gay. I find this silly and immature, but I can see how some readers would find it insulting. I don't know if Details has always done this or if the Anthropology page has been different in the past. But this is how it has been in every issue I have read and it needs to be changed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Advertisements claim about sixty percent of the pages in each issue of this magazine. They cover products like liquor, cars, electronics, cigarettes, fragrance, etc. Even though this magazine covers lots of different things, the item most often featured in the advertisements is clothing. The magazine seems to have a penchant for high fashion and it devotes more pages to expensive clothing than anything else. And each issue often has its own unique smell, thanks to all of the cologne samples. You can flip through the pages and find several samples in each issue, with many of the latest and trendiest scents from the biggest names in cologne.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, I am torn between liking or not liking Details Magazine. I like some of the articles on food, drink, politics and the like. But I don't necessarily like the shallow fluff that is often substituted for an intellectual discussion and I can understand how some readers would find certain aspects of this magazine insulting. This magazine is deserving of only about two and one- half stars which I will round up to three stars and give a small recommendation. Some will like this magazine and some will not. It's all a matter of what you like to read about and whether or not you can handle a magazine that pushes the envelope.</td><td>03 15, 2006</td><td>A3JPFWKS83R49V</td><td>Bryan Carey</td><td>null</td><td>Give Me the Details</td><td>1142380800</td><td>false</td><td>98</td></tr><tr><td>B00005N7PS</td><td>null</td><td>1.0</td><td>Hi, I am writing this review in an attempt to help you save $10.

I actually finished the entire magazine between PM mail delivery and breakfast the next day. The topics they covered in my first issue ranged from fashion to health concerns. And, again, they cover the topics in very few, well-written pages. I do think the models look like under-fed children but at my age, that could be tunnel-vision (grey hair, I remember Filmore East, you get the picture?). My suggestion, take a look.

This magazine is aimed in one primary direction: Making the most out of the electronic devices available. This is accomplished through the many instructional articles, how to guides, and question and answer sessions.\n",
       "\n",
       "When Maximum PC isn't offering words of wisdom on ways to improve your life with electronics, the magazine is usually offering reviews of new products. The reviews section is one of the largest parts of each issue and while it does a nice job bringing new products to the forefront, the reviews are often less than stellar. Rather than analyze a few products in- depth, Maximum PC instead prefers to offer shorter reviews of many products. This part of the magazine seems more concerned with quantity than quality, in contrast to most of the remainder of the magazine.\n",
       "\n",
       "One thing about Maximum PC that isn't to my liking is the technical nature of many articles. Maximum PC likes to get to the root of things (literally), and it is common to find articles talking about circuits, memory, and other boring subjects. This is fine for those who take their technology to the extremes, but I have no interest in learning about the inter-workings of the wiring inside my personal computer or the electronic pulses that cause my printer to respond on queue. This is a little too much technology for me, but I know there are some readers who will relish the depths that Maximum PC goes to when it strips down electronic devices into their component parts.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, Maximum PC is a pretty good electronics magazine for young and middle- aged adults. It loses me from time to time when it gets overly technical, but it still ranks as a good magazine about electronics. The numerous question and answer sessions, the educational articles, and the product reviews make this a magazine worth reading.</td><td>09 24, 2007</td><td>A3JPFWKS83R49V</td><td>Bryan Carey</td><td>null</td><td>Maximizing Electronics Enjoyment</td><td>1190592000</td><td>false</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>B00005N7P0</td><td>null</td><td>5.0</td><td>After going through pretty much all the PC type magazines out there I finally found what I consider the best one out there.

       "It's hard to put a finger on what makes this magazine so appealing to someone like me.  First I like the style.  Other reviewrs have described it as edgy, but I think of it as fun and accessible.  I have ever read any other PC book or magazine that I would describe as anything even close to fun, but this one definately is.  Secondly, it has fascinating hardware articles that are incredibly clear and understandable.  I have learned more about video cards, memory types, and processors than I ever thought I would want to learn, all while being entertained.  I have to admit that the article on building your own super PC made me want to do just that, although I would opt for the budget version, which they also included in the article. Finally, the software reviews are first class, honest, and hardhitting.  They are written by avid, unabashed gamers, and they are not shy about calling a toad a toad.  I have used their reviews to buy christmas and birthday gifts and have never been disappointed.\n",

They are all very helpful, and like others have mentioned, this is the only hardcore PC magazine around. I have written reviews about PC World, giving it bad reviews because the fact is, it won't give the content that MaxPC will. Will you EVER see an article about WATER COOLING in a PC World mag? No way! But in MaxPC, that was what the cover story was for its last issue. This mag actually TELLS YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR COMPUTER! You will see motherboard reviews, CPU reviews, graphics card reviews, case modding guides, PC fix-it guides, overclocking guides, the information is endless and informative. Forget PC World.

       "Maximum PC contains great tips, editorials, watch-outs, tutorials, and equipment reviews. Don't worry about not getting the disk. After buying a few newsstand issues with the disk, I decided that the magazine content was more valuable than the few demos or utilities you may get on the disk.\n",
       "My only complaint: It is too bad that they use a rather in-your-face style with \"kick-a**\" reviews, frequent talk of downloading porn, and other crudeness.

While it probably isn't cost effective to build your own system other than to impress your friends you can compare your list of components with those of the smaller computer manufacturers and come pretty close for a lot lower price.  This magazine is for someone who isn't afraid to open the case and change boards or to buy a computer from someone other than the big boys with their prepackaged systems.  You might consider this magazine if you are asking yourself why do I have to buy an extra monitor, mouse, keyboard and floppy drive with a new system?\n",
       "  The magazine does describe in fairly good detail how to modify your system to make it what you want.  This month they even discussed what you can and can't do in upgrading a laptop including the reasons why.\n",

I realize that gaming is driving the leading edge of the sound, video and computer speed advancments and that digital music is driving R/W CD's so the magazine is geared to those interests.\n",

It is well organized and allows you to glance through it with their summarizing \"Verdict\" boxes on each review. The editors are very good about keeping with their readers, effectively relating to them.\n",
       "A flagship occurance, as many other readers will tell you, that sets this magazine apart is that you might find a review telling you how horrible the product is on one page and on the next see an advertisement for that same product. I build many computers and I rarely disagree with their reviews. Another useful item is the benchmark, which lets you compare system and laptop performance to others they have reviewed as well as to your own.\n",
       "For hardcore users, the magazine provides dependable, in-depth reviews. For beginners, it might be very intimidating, but after a couple issues, you should catch on to the style and humor enough to know more than the average person.\n",

Sure, there is occasional juvenile humor, but for the demographic they write for (technology hobbyists) this is perfect.

       "Max PC doesn't talk about run-of-the-mill stuff, it talks about the cutting edge of what is available NOW.

Don't even get me started on the fluffy features with celebrities who I don't care about or the annoying how-to section.  In a world of independant beauty blogs that aren't afraid to trash a product,  Youtube channels owned by pro-makeup artists,  and skincare sites run by practicing dermatologists,  Allure seems like a waste of paper and good money.</td><td>05 22, 2009</td><td>AV76UXUZXYXYP</td><td>Selenite</td><td>List( Print Magazine)</td><td>Allure is annoying</td><td>1242950400</td><td>false</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>B00005N7OD</td><td>null</td><td>4.0</td><td>As a typical young female, I've read a lot of different magazines geared toward women. Most, in general, feature the same articles month after month, and therefore become repetitive and boring.  Let's face it: there is only so much you can take reading about \"The Best Bedroom Moves\" issue after issue.  Allure, however, never seems dull or filled with useless amounts of recycled information.\n",
       "\n",
       "I began subscribing to the magazine at age 18 (I'm 23 now) and have never been disappointed.  Allure has articles for every age, and I find relevant information for my life, body, and health, and then I am able to find information that will interest and benefit my 50+ year old mother.  Perhaps that is part of the appeal of the magazine: any age group can enjoy it.  Not many magazines can say that.\n",
       "\n",
       "Unlike many other female-geared magazines, Allure offers more than just underwear pictures and \"how to please your man\" articles.  Each issue, Allure has an entire section dedicated to new health science discoveries, such as new updates about skin cancer and sleep problems. The magazine seems genuinely about women, beauty, and health, whereas other magazines make some feminists role their eyes (\"how to please your man,\" anyone?)\n",

I'm a pretty girl in good physical health, and I still- at times- feel inadequate when reading the many awesome articles of this magazine.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, I recommend Allure highly to women of all ages, shapes, and sizes.

I love it in principle -- a magazine devoted to beauty with a heavy focus on makeup. The content, however, is short on how-to and long on buy-this-product. Much of the makeup is expensive and exclusive, unavailable to the majority of the buying public. They're constantly raving over products that are quite frankly terrible, to the point where seeing Allure recommend something actually makes me less likely to try it. The fashion spreads are pointless and would be better left out, focusing on expensive items, unwearable trends, or flash-in-the-pan fads. The \"Makeup Colors\" technique is always frustrating, as the listed products never even resemble the actual look achieved. This problem is worsened by the fact that the colors of featured products rarely render true on the pages; I get sick of buying a cosmetic product only to find the color looks nothing like the way it looked on the page. It swings wildly between trends and recommendations with no apparent sense of coherence to it; its advice frequently contradicts itself from one month to the next. Finally, its focus on fluffy celebrity, name brand clothes, and rich-and-famous lifestyles (it's obsessed with recommending clothes and etiquette for red-carpet \"parties\" of the kind I can't begin to relate to) leads the average reader to develop a massive inferiority complex.\n",

And the monthly article on an acting/recording star is a waste of space.  But the makeup section and the beauty tips are great.  One of my favorite sections is the Directory, which features top beauty salons in major cities around the country.  For the past year \"Allure\" has also run a monthly makeover section featuring two women who underwent a year-long makeover mostly dedicated to losing weight and shaping up; the subjects are women readers can identify with.  \"Allure\" is one of the few fashion/beauty magazines to regularly feature models of all ethnic groups in their editorial pages with makeup shades that look good on women of every shade from ebony to ivory.  One of \"Allure\"'s greatest strengths is that they don't pander to any makeup company or brand; they are upfront about what works and what doesn't.  They have also run some serious articles about the pluses and negatives of cosmetic surgery and the risks involved.

Maybe it's because I'm older than the typical MH reader, but the magazine's recent design change is terrible. The latest issue (July/August 2017) is more of a comic book. Also, what's with devoting 8 magazine pages to dogs? Maybe there's more truth there than MH's editors know. It used to take me several hours to read an entire issue; now, I can do it during commercials while watching a baseball game.
